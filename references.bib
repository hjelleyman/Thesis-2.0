abstract = {1 We demonstrate a mechanism whereby the impact of stronger circumpolar westerly winds on the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula contributes significantly to the enhanced warming trend observed over its western side in the last 50 years. Numerical and laboratory meteorological modelling demonstrate how, when westerly winds impinge on this side, warm air below the height (1.5-2.0 km) of the Peninsula is advected in a southerly direction. The strength of the annual mean westerly winds has increased by about 15-20{\%} since the 1960s, while the modelling results indicate that contemporaneously the air advected to its western side originates from an increasingly northerly (and warmer) location. This gives rise to increased northerlies and a greater transport of warm air into this region. Consequently there is a reduction in the sea-ice extent, further amplifying the local warming. This 'low-level', orographic mechanism for the local climate trend is supported by observational evidence.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian peninsular using nonlinear spatial correlations. This analysis is carried out employing the tools of complex networks and a measure of nonlinear correlation for point processes such as rainfall, called event synchronization. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial organization, scales, and structure of the 90th and 94th percentile rainfall events during the Indian summer monsoon (June–September). We furthermore analyse the influence of different critical synoptic atmospheric systems and the impact of the steep Himalayan topography on rainfall patterns. The presented method not only helps us in visualising the structure of the extreme-event rainfall fields, but also identifies the water vapor pathways and decadal-scale moisture sinks over the region. Furthermore a simple scheme based on complex networks is presented to decipher the spatial intricacies and temporal evolution of monsoonal rainfall patterns over the last 6 decades.},

abstract = {The Reference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research (READER) project data set of monthly mean Antarctic near-surface temperature, mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) and wind speed has been used to investigate trends in these quantities over the last 50 years for 19 stations with long records. Eleven of these had warming trends and seven had cooling trends in their annual data (one station had too little data to allow an annual trend to be computed), indicating the spatial complexity of change that has occurred across the Antarctic in recent decades. The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a major warming over the last 50 years, with temperatures at Faraday/Vernadsky station having increased at a rate of 0.56°C decade -1 over the year and 1.09°C decade -1 during the winter; both figures are statistically significant at less than the 5{\%} level. Overlapping 30 year trends of annual mean temperatures indicate that, at all but two of the 10 coastal stations for which trends could be computed back to 1961, the warming trend was greater (or the cooling trend less) during the 1961-90 period compared with 1971-2000. All the continental stations for which MSLP data were available show negative trends in the annual mean pressures over the full length of their records, which we attribute to the trend in recent decades towards the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) being in its high-index state. Except for Halley, where the trends are constant, the MSLP trends for all stations on the Antarctic continent for 1971-2000 were more negative than for 1961-90. All but two of the coastal stations have recorded increasing mean wind speeds over recent decades, which is also consistent with the change  in the nature of the SAM.

Decreases occur in all seasons and on a yeafly average basis, although they are largest in spring and smallest in autumn. Regionally, the Kara and Barents Seas have the largest decreases, at-15,200 + 1900 km2/yr (-10.5{\%}/decade), followed by the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan, the Arctic Ocean, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, and Canadian Archipelago. The yeafly average trends for the total, the Kara and Barents Seas, and the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan all have high statistical significance, with the null hypothesis of a 0 slope being rejected at a 99{\%} confidence level. Regions showing increasing yeafly average ice extents are Baffin Bay/Labrador Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Bering Sea, with only the increases in the Gulf of St. Lawrence being statistically significant at the 99{\%} level. Hemispheric results for sea ice areas exhibit the same-2.8{\%}/decade decrease as for ice extents and hence a lower absolute decrease (-29,500 + 3800 km2/yr), with the ice-free area within the ice pack correspondingly decreasing at-4800 + 1600 km2/yr. Confidence levels for the trends in ice areas and ice-free water areas exceed 99{\%} and 95{\%}, respectively. Nonetheless, interannual variability is high, and, for instance, the Arctic Ocean ice extents have a positive trend 1990-1996, in spite of their negative trend for the time period as a whole.},

Each atmospheric pattern is described after analyzing its development and evolution.

While melt onset trends are generally smaller, the timing of melt onset has a large influence on the total amount of solar energy absorbed during summer. The additional heat stored in the upper ocean of approximately 752MJm?2 during the last decade increases sea surface temperatures by 0.5 to 1.5 °C and largely explains the observed delays in autumn freezeup within the Arctic Ocean's adjacent seas. Cumulative anomalies in total absorbed solar radiation from May through September for the most recent pentad locally exceed 300–400MJm?2 in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and East Siberian seas. This extra solar energy is equivalent to melting 0.97 to 1.3m of ice during the summer.},

The latter provides an example of a system that features robust homoclinic tangencies; one also speaks of `wild chaos' in contrast to the `classi- cal chaos' where homoclinic tangencies can only occur densely, and not robustly in open intervals in parameter space. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the manifestation of chaotic dynamics in the three-dimensional phase space of the Lorenz system, and illustrate the geometry behind the process that results in its description by a one- dimensional noninvertible map. For the higher-dimensional Lorenz-type system, the corresponding reduction process leads to a two-dimensional noninvertible map in- troduced in 2006 by Bamo´ n, Kiwi, and Rivera-Letelier [arXiv 0508045] as a system displaying wild chaos. We present the geometric ingredients — in the form of dif- ferent types of tangency bifurcations — that one encounters on the route to wild chaos.},

At the heart of the chapter are four examples of practice drawn from our direct experiences of creating and researching arts projects within community settings.

There is a distinct annual contrast between the 1980s and the 1990s, with the strong teleconnection in the 1990s being explained by an enhanced response during austral spring. Geopotential height anomaly composites constructed during the peak ENSO seasons also demonstrate the decadal variability. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis reveals that the 1980s September-November (SON) tele-connection is weak due to the interference between the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern associated with ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). An in-phase relationship between these two modes during SON in the 1990s amplifies the height and pressure anomalies in the South Pacific, producing the strong teleconnections seen in the correlation and composite analyses. The in-phase relationship between the tropical and high-latitude forcing also exists in December-February (DJF) during the 1980s and 1990s. These results suggest that natural climate variability plays an important role in the variability of SAM, in agreement with a growing body of literature. Additionally, the significantly positive correlation between ENSO and SAM only during times of strong teleconnection suggests that both the Tropics and the high latitudes need to work together in order for ENSO to strongly influence Antarctic climate.},

abstract = {Time series are characterized by a myriad of different shapes and structures. A number of events that appear in atmospheric time series result from as yet unidentified physical mechanisms. This is particularly the case for stable boundary layers, where the usual statistical turbulence approaches do not work well and increasing evidence relates the bulk of their dynamics to generally unknown individual events. This study explores the possibility of extracting and classifying events from time series without previous knowledge of their generating mechanisms. The goal is to group large numbers of events in a useful way that will open a pathway for the detailed study of their characteristics, and help gain understanding of events with previously unknown origin. A two-step method is developed that extracts events from background fluctuations and groups dynamically similar events into clusters. The method is tested on artificial time series with different levels of complexity and on atmospheric turbulence time series. The results indicate that the method successfully recognizes and classifies various events of unknown origin, and even distinguishes different physical characteristics based only on a single-variable time series. The method is simple and highly flexible, and it does not assume any knowledge about the shape geometries, amplitudes or underlying physical mechanisms. Therefore, with proper modifications, it can be applied to time series from a wider range of research areas.},

abstract = {Melt onset dates, freeze onset dates, and melt season duration were estimated over Arctic sea ice, 1979-2001, using passive microwave satellite imagery and surface air temperature data. Sea ice melt duration for the entire Northern Hemisphere varied from a 104-day minimum in 1983 and 1996, to a 124-day maximum in 1989. Ranges in melt duration were highest in peripheral seas, numbering 32, 42, 44, and 51 days in the Laptev, Barents-Kara, East Siberian and Chukchi Seas, respectively. In the Arctic Ocean, average melt duration varied from a 75-day minimum in 1987 to a 103-day maximum in 1989. On average, melt onset in annual ice began 10.6 days earlier than perennial ice, and freeze onset in perennial ice commenced 18.4 days earlier than annual ice. Average annual melt dates, freeze dates, and melt durations in annual ice were significantly correlated with seasonal strength of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Following high-index AO winters (January-March), spring melt tended to be earlier and autumn freeze later, leading to longer melt season durations. The largest increases in melt duration were observed in the eastern Siberian Arctic, coincident with cyclonic low pressure and ice motion anomalies associated with high-index AO phases. Following a positive AO shift in 1989, mean annual melt duration increased 2-3 weeks in the northern East Siberian and Chukchi Seas. Decreasing correlations between consecutive-year maps of melt onset in annual ice during 1979-2001 indicated increasing spatial variability and unpredictability in melt distributions from one year to the next. Despite recent declines in the winter AO index, recent melt distributions did not show evidence of reestablishing spatial patterns similar to those observed during the 1979-88 low-index AO period. Recent freeze distributions have become increasingly similar to those observed during 1979-88, suggesting a recurrent spatial pattern of freeze chronology under low-index AO conditions.},

To clarify the relation between language and arithmetic, we studied numerical cognition in speakers of Munduruk{\'{u}}, an Amazonian language with a very small lexicon of number words. Although the Munduruk{\'{u}} lack words for numbers beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers that are far beyond their naming range. However, they fail in exact arithmetic with numbers larger than 4 or 5. Our results imply a distinction between a nonverbal system of number approximation and a language-based counting system for exact number and arithmetic.},

abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m {\~{}} n and d {\~{}} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log{\^{}}2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

abstract = {The influence of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on Antarctic sea ice extent has not been extensively explored. This study investigates intraseasonal variability of the sea ice extent induced by the MJO and its physical mechanism. During austral winter, the sea ice extent anomaly exhibits considerable melting and freezing as the MJO evolves. Numerical experiments and the Rossby wave theory show that the high-latitude circulation anomalies in response to the MJO are responsible for the sea ice change. The MJO-induced Rossby waves propagate into the Southern Hemisphere through the northerly ducts over the western Indian Ocean–central Africa and the Maritime Continent. The MJO-induced circulation anomalies reach high latitudes and lead to anomalous meridional temperature advection, causing changes in the sea ice extent. The time difference between the meridional wind and sea ice anomalies is {\~{}}5 days. As the MJO moves, the sea ice extent anomaly also exhibits eastward-migrating behavior. Strong sea ice melting in the total anomaly is synchronous to the evolution of the MJO, suggesting the practical usefulness of the location of the MJO for the prediction of the sea ice decrease.},

abstract = {[1] Variability in time series of ice conditions in the Baltic Sea is examined within the context of atmospheric circulation represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) winter indices using the wavelet approach. We develop methods of assessing statistical significance and confidence intervals of cross-wavelet phase and wavelet coherence. Cross-wavelet power for the time series indicates that the times of largest variance in ice conditions are in excellent agreement with significant power in the AO at 2.2 - 3.5, 5.7 - 7.8, and 12 - 20 year periods, similar patterns are also seen with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Nino3 sea surface temperature (Nino3) series. Wavelet coherence shows in-phase linkages between the 2.2 - 7.8 and 12 - 20 year period signals in both tropical and Arctic atmospheric circulation and also with ice conditions in the Baltic Sea. These results are consistent with GCM simulations showing dynamical connections between high-latitude surface conditions, tropical sea surface temperatures mediated by tropical wave propagation, the wintertime polar vortex, and the AO and with models of sea ice and oceanic feedbacks at decadal periods.},

abstract = {  Wild chaos is a type of chaotic dynamics that can arise in a continuous-time dynamical system of dimension at least four. We are interested in the possible bifurcations or sequence of bifurcations that generate this type of chaos in dynamical systems. We focus our investigation on a planar noninvertible map introduced by Bamon, Kiwi, and Rivera-Letelier [Wild Lorenz-Like Attractors, arXiv 0508045, 2006] to prove the existence of wild chaos in a five-dimensional Lorenz-like system. The map opens up the origin (the critical point) to a disk and wraps the plane twice around it; points inside the disk have no preimage. The bounding critical circle and its images, together with the critical point and its preimages, form the so-called critical set. This set interacts with the stable and unstable sets of a saddle fixed point. Advanced numerical techniques enable us to study how the stable and unstable sets change as a parameter is varied along a path towards the wild chaotic regime. We find four types of bifurcations: The stable and unstable sets interact with each other in homoclinic tangencies (which also occur in invertible maps), and they interact with the critical set in three types of bifurcations specific to noninvertible maps, which cause changes (such as self-intersections) of the topology of these global invariant sets. Overall, a consistent sequence of all four types of bifurcations emerges, which we present as a first attempt towards explaining the geometric nature of wild chaos. Using two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show that essentially the same sequences of bifurcations occur along different paths towards the wild chaotic regime, and we use this information to obtain an indication of the size of the parameter region where wild chaos exists.

One is the planar silicon pn-diode with electroplating of /sup 63/Ni thin film, and the other is the bulk micromachined pn-junction structure with the inverted pyramid array. The obtained power is on the scale of one-nanowatt with an open circuit voltage of 128 millivolts, and a short circuit current of 2.86 nA. The output power can be increased using greater activity and efficient collector designs.},

abstract = {While it is an important problem to identify the existence of causal associations between two components of a multivariate time series, a topic addressed in Runge et al. (2012), it is even more important to assess the strength of their association in a meaningful way. In the present article we focus on the problem of defining a meaningful coupling strength using information theoretic measures and demonstrate the short-comings of the well-known mutual information and transfer entropy. Instead, we propose a certain time-delayed conditional mutual information, the momentary information transfer (MIT), as a measure of association that is general, causal and lag-specific, reflects a well interpretable notion of coupling strength and is practically computable. MIT is based on the fundamental concept of source entropy, which we utilize to yield a notion of coupling strength that is, compared to mutual information and transfer entropy, well interpretable, in that for many cases it solely depends on the interaction of the two components at a certain lag. In particular, MIT is thus in many cases able to exclude the misleading influence of autodependency within a process in an information-theoretic way. We formalize and prove this idea analytically and numerically for a general class of nonlinear stochastic processes and illustrate the potential of MIT on climatological data.},

abstract = {  Across geosciences, many investigated phenomena relate to specific complex systems consisting of intricately intertwined interacting subsystems. Such dynamical complex systems can be represented by a directed graph, where each link denotes an existence of a causal relation, or information exchange between the nodes. For geophysical systems such as global climate, these relations are commonly not theoretically known but estimated from recorded data using causality analysis methods. These include bivariate nonlinear methods based on information theory and their linear counterpart. The trade-off between the valuable sensitivity of nonlinear methods to more general interactions and the potentially higher numerical reliability of linear methods may affect inference regarding structure and variability of climate networks. We investigate the reliability of directed climate networks detected by selected methods and parameter settings, using a stationarized model of dimensionality-reduced surface air temperature data from reanalysis of 60-year global climate records. Overall, all studied bivariate causality methods provided reproducible estimates of climate causality networks, with the linear approximation showing higher reliability than the investigated nonlinear methods. On the example dataset, optimizing the investigated nonlinear methods with respect to reliability increased the similarity of the detected networks to their linear counterparts, supporting the particular hypothesis of the near-linearity of the surface air temperature reanalysis data.},

While previous work has linked this warming to reductions in sea ice cover, we note that a substantial (30–60{\%}) portion of the warming is related to changes in the SON atmospheric circulation. In particular, western Antarctic Peninsula warming is consistent with increasing pressure in the South Atlantic, while western West Antarctica warming is tied to a deepening of the Amundsen Sea low near the eastern Ross Sea. While both of these circulation changes are associated with increased warm, northerly flow toward the Antarctic continent, they are connected with different aspects of tropical variability. The increase in pressure in the South Atlantic is associated with a trend toward more La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions in the tropical Pacific, and an associated Rossby wave train. In contrast, the deepening of the Amundsen Sea low is more strongly tied to a shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) toward its negative phase since the 1990s. Compared to typical La Ni{\~{n}}a events, the recent negative PDO events display a different tropical forcing, which drives a Rossby wave train that propagates more meridionally across the South Pacific, culminating in the eastern Ross Sea, rather than in the South Atlantic.

In particular, western Antarctic Peninsula warming is consistent with increasing pressure in the South Atlantic, while western West Antarctica warming is tied to a deepening of the Amundsen Sea low near the eastern Ross Sea. While both of these circulation changes are associated with increased warm, northerly flow toward the Antarctic continent, they are connected with different aspects of tropical variability. The increase in pressure in the South Atlantic is associated with a trend toward more La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions in the tropical Pacific, and an associated Rossby wave train. In contrast, the deepening of the Amundsen Sea low is more strongly tied to a shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) toward its negative phase since the 1990s. Compared to typical La Ni{\~{n}}a events, the recent negative PDO events display a different tropical forcing, which drives a Rossby wave train that propagates more meridionally across the South Pacific, culminating in the eastern Ross Sea, rather than in the South Atlantic. The results suggest multiple independent forcing mechanisms governing the SON pressure trends and associated Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica warming after 1979, which partially cancel each other out in the Amundsen Sea and portions of eastern West Antarctica.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Royal Meteorological Society We objectively identified an optimal number of atmospheric weather regimes, also called synoptic types, within the southwest (SW) Pacific tropical–subtropical domain and examined their potential drivers. Six atmospheric weather regimes in this region are characterized by spatially heterogeneous geopotential height, sea surface temperature, and regional precipitation patterns. The identified weather regimes are phase-locked to the seasonal cycle with a moderate degree of coherency, and some are capable of persisting for weeks or more in extreme cases. Correlations between the SW Pacific weather regimes and global precipitation reanalysis fields indicate a strong connection between regional weather patterns and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) mean position changes and relative intensity of convective loci within the SPCZ. Climate field correlations to SW Pacific weather regimes also show distinct geopotential height and SST signatures across Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes and the Indian Ocean basin. Strong statistical significance for portions of those spatial patterns lends support to the assertion of extra-basin teleconnections for SW Pacific weather regimes. There are strong precipitatio n impacts from SW Pacific weather regime frequency changes and regime persistence on extreme rainfall deficits and/or surpluses for small islands during austral summer. Diagnostic analysis of the spatial correlation fields and each weather regime indicates these weather patterns are connected to eastern equatorial Pacific-styles of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a and Modoki La Ni{\~{n}}a. Another regime type appears to be connected to an enhancement of the Hadley–Ferrell circulation, while two other types are influenced by phenomena that arise outside the Pacific basin (Madden–Julian oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, and Pacific South American mode). SW Pacific weather regime investigations in the context of modern climate, palaeoclimatology, and future climate change scenarios can help to surmount spatial-scale mismatches that exist between global models and small Pacific islands, while helping to improve general understanding of island-scale impacts from atmospheric circulation.},

STL has a simple design that consists of a sequence of applications of the loess smoother; the simplicity allows analysis of the properties of the procedure and allows fast computation, even for very long time series and large amounts of trend and seasonal smoothing. Other features of STL are specification of amounts of seasonal and trend smoothing that range, in a nearly continuous way, from a very small amount of smoothing to a very large amount; robust estimates of the trend and seasonal components that are not distorted by aberrant behavior in the data; specification of the period of the seasonal component to any integer multiple of the time sampling interval greater than one; and the ability to decompose time series with missing values.},

abstract = {When two pedestrians travelling in opposite directions approach one another, each must decide on which side (the left or the right) they will attempt to pass. If both make the same choice then passing can be completed with ease, while if they make opposite choices an embarrassing stand-off or collision can occur. Pedestrians who encounter each other frequently can establish "social norms" that bias this decision. In this study we investigate the effect of binary decision-making by pedestrians when passing on the dynamics of pedestrian flows in order to study the emergence of a social norm in crowds with a mixture of individual biases. Such a situation may arise, for instance, when individuals from different communities mix at a large sporting event or at transport hubs. We construct a phase diagram that shows that a social norm can still emerge provided pedestrians are sufficiently attentive to the choices of others in the crowd. We show that this collective behaviour has the potential to greatly influence the dynamics of pedestrians, including the breaking of symmetry by the formation of lanes.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF},

Here we demonstrate that circulation changes associated with the SAM dominate interannual temperature variability across the entire Antarctic Peninsula during both summer and autumn, while relationships with tropical Pacific SST variability associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are strongest and statistically significant primarily during winter and spring only.

To better understand the evolution of these regional sea ice trends, we utilize the full temporal (quasi-daily) resolution of satellite-derived sea ice data to track spatially the annual ice edge advance and retreat from 1979 to 2004. These newly analyzed data reveal that sea ice is retreating 31 ± 10 days earlier and advancing 54 ± 9 days later in the wAP/sBS region (i.e., total change over 1979–2004), whereas in the wRS region, sea ice is retreating 29 ± 6 days later and advancing 31 ± 6 days earlier. Changes in the wAP/sBS and wRS regions, particularly as observed during sea ice advance, occurred in association with decadal changes in the mean state of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; negative in the 1980s and positive in the 1990s) and the high-latitude response to El Nin ˜o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In general, the high-latitude ice-atmosphere response to ENSO was strongest when -SAM was coincident with El Nin ˜o and when +SAM was coincident with La Nin ˜a, particularly in the wAP/sBS region. In total, there were 7 of 11 -SAMs between 1980 and 1990 and the 7 of 10 +SAMs between 1991 and 2000 that were associated with consistent decadal sea ice changes in the wAP/sBS and wRS regions, respectively. Elsewhere, ENSO/SAM- related sea ice changes were not as consistent over time (e.g., western Weddell, Amundsen, and eastern Ross Sea region), or variability in general was high (e.g., central/ eastern Weddell and along East Antarctica).},

abstract = {Several papers have described a significant trend toward the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a "true" benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined. In this paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the SAM so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true temporal changes: six stations are used to calculate a proxy zonal mean sea level pressure (MSLP) at both 40° and 65°S during 1958-2000. The observed increase in the difference in zonal MSLP between 40° (increasing) and 65°S (decreasing) is shown to be statistically significant, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s. However, it is demonstrated that calculated trends in the MSLP difference between 40° and 65°S and the SAM itself are exaggerated by a factor of 3 and 2. respectively, in the NNR. The SH high-latitude errors in the early part of this reanalysis are greatest in winter as are subsequent improvements. As a result, the NNR shows the greatest seasonal trend in the SAM to be in the austral winter, in marked contrast to observational data, which reveal the largest real increase to be in summer. Equivalent datafrom two ECMWF reanalyses, including part of the new ERA-40 reanalysis. are also examined. It is demonstrated that ERA-40 provides an improved representation of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability that can be used with high confidence at least as far back as 1973- and is therefore ideal for examining the recent trend in the SAM- and with more confidence than the NNR right back to 1958.},

abstract = {In the past years, the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes have suffered from severe winters like the extreme 2012/2013 winter in Eastern USA. These cold spells were linked to a meandering upper tropospheric jet stream pattern and a negative Arctic Oscillation Index (AO). However, the nature of the drivers behind these circulation patterns remains controversial. Various studies have proposed different mechanisms related to changes in the Arctic, most of them related to a reduction in sea ice concentrations or increasing Eurasian snow cover. Here, a novel type of time series analysis, called Causal Effect Networks (CEN) based on graphical models is introduced to assess causal relationships and their time-delays between different processes. The effect of different Arctic actors on winter circulation on weekly to monthly time-scales is studied and robust network patterns are found. Barents and Kara sea ice concentrations are detected to be important external drivers of the mid-latitude circulation, influencing winter AO via tropospheric mechanisms and through processes involving the Stratosphere. Eurasia snow cover is also detected to have a causal effect on sea level pressure in Asia, but its exact role on AO remains unclear. The CEN approach presented in this study overcomes some difficulties in interpreting correlation analyses, complements model experiments for testing hypotheses involving teleconnections, and can be used to assess their validity. Our findings confirm that sea ice concentrations in autumn in the Barents and Kara Seas are an important driver of winter circulation in the mid-latitudes.},

abstract = {Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies using change-point methods to detect artificial or natural discontinuities and regime shifts in climate. However, a major drawback with most of the currently used change-point methods is the lack of flexibility (able to detect one specific type of shift under the assumption that the residuals are independent). As temporal variations in climate are complex, it may be difficult to identify change points with very simple models. Moreover, climate time series are known to exhibit autocorrelation, which corresponds to a model misspecification if not taken into account and can lead to the detection of non-existent shifts. In this study, we extend a method known as the informational approach for change-point detection to take into account the presence of autocorrelation in the model. The usefulness and flexibility of this approach are demonstrated through applications. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that can detect shifts soon after they occur for climate monitoring. To address this, we also carried out a simulation study in order to investigate the number of years after which an abrupt shift is detectable. We use two decision rules in order to decide whether a shift is detected or not, which represents a trade-off between increasing our chances of detecting a shift and reducing the risk of detecting a shift while in reality there is none. We show that, as of now, we have good chances to detect an abrupt shift with a magnitude that is larger than that of the standard deviation in the series of observations. For shifts with a very large magnitude (three times the standard deviation), our simulation study shows that after only 4 years the probabilities of shift detection reach nearly 100 per cent. This reveals that the approach has potential for climate monitoring.},

abstract = {Melt onset dates, freeze onset dates, and melt season duration were estimated over Arctic sea ice, 1979-2001, using passive microwave satellite imagery and surface air temperature data. Sea ice melt duration for the entire Northern Hemisphere varied from a 104-day minimum in 1983 and 1996, to a 124-day maximum in 1989. Ranges in melt duration were highest in peripheral seas, numbering 32, 42, 44, and 51 days in the Laptev, Barents-Kara, East Siberian and Chukchi Seas, respectively. In the Arctic Ocean, average melt duration varied from a 75-day minimum in 1987 to a 103-day maximum in 1989. On average, melt onset in annual ice began 10.6 days earlier than perennial ice, and freeze onset in perennial ice commenced 18.4 days earlier than annual ice. Average annual melt dates, freeze dates, and melt durations in annual ice were significantly correlated with seasonal strength of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Following high-index AO winters (January-March), spring melt tended to be earlier and autumn freeze later, leading to longer melt season durations. The largest increases in melt duration were observed in the eastern Siberian Arctic, coincident with cyclonic low pressure and ice motion anomalies associated with high-index AO phases. Following a positive AO shift in 1989, mean annual melt duration increased 2-3 weeks in the northern East Siberian and Chukchi Seas. Decreasing correlations between consecutive-year maps of melt onset in annual ice during 1979-2001 indicated increasing spatial variability and unpredictability in melt distributions from one year to the next. Despite recent declines in the winter AO index, recent melt distributions did not show evidence of reestablishing spatial patterns similar to those observed during the 1979-88 low-index AO period. Recent freeze distributions have become increasingly similar to those observed during 1979-88, suggesting a recurrent spatial pattern of freeze chronology under low-index AO conditions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To evaluate the greatest impact that sea-ice anomalies around Antarctica could have on the global atmosphere, 15 year seasonal cycle simulations are conducted with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model version 2.1. Sensitivity simulations are performed with the following conditions: (1) all sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere is replaced by year-round open water, but the permanent ice shelves are retained (NSIS); and (2) all sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere and the major ice shelves are removed and replaced by open water (NISH). The results are compared to a standard run (CNT) with boundary conditions set for the present climate. The comparison shows that trains of positive and negative anomalies in zonal-mean fields extend into the tropical latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Anomalies are largest during April-October. The additional removal of the ice shelves in NISH enhances the response, as zonally averaged anomalies are similar in pattern to those in NSIS but are roughly twice as large poleward of 50° S, and only slightly larger farther north. Anomalies in the eddy fields are found in both hemispheres. in NISH, and to a lesser degree in NSIS. these anomalies appear to be related to a delayed northern advance over China during June of the rain front associated with the summer monsoon. Consequently, precipitation is enhanced in middle and southern China and decreased in northern China. Observational analyses have also found links between Antarctic sea-ice variations and modulations of the East Asian monsoon.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m {\~{}} n and d {\~{}} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log{\^{}}2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

abstract = {After 1979, statistically significant warming in Antarctica is only observed in austral spring (September–November, SON) across West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. While previous work has linked this warming to reductions in sea ice cover, we note that a substantial (30–60{\%}) portion of the warming is related to changes in the SON atmospheric circulation. In particular, western Antarctic Peninsula warming is consistent with increasing pressure in the South Atlantic, while western West Antarctica warming is tied to a deepening of the Amundsen Sea low near the eastern Ross Sea. While both of these circulation changes are associated with increased warm, northerly flow toward the Antarctic continent, they are connected with different aspects of tropical variability. The increase in pressure in the South Atlantic is associated with a trend toward more La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions in the tropical Pacific, and an associated Rossby wave train. In contrast, the deepening of the Amundsen Sea low is more strongly tied to a shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) toward its negative phase since the 1990s. Compared to typical La Ni{\~{n}}a events, the recent negative PDO events display a different tropical forcing, which drives a Rossby wave train that propagates more meridionally across the South Pacific, culminating in the eastern Ross Sea, rather than in the South Atlantic. The results suggest multiple independent forcing mechanisms governing the SON pressure trends and associated Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica warming after 1979, which partially cancel each other out in the Amundsen Sea and portions of eastern West Antarctica.},

abstract = {Over the last three decades, the South Pole has experienced a record-high statistically significant warming of 0.61 ± 0.34 °C per decade, more than three times the global average. Here, we use an ensemble of climate model experiments to show this recent warming lies within the upper bounds of the simulated range of natural variability. The warming resulted from a strong cyclonic anomaly in the Weddell Sea caused by increasing sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific. This circulation, coupled with a positive polarity of the Southern Annular Mode, advected warm and moist air from the South Atlantic into the Antarctic interior. These results underscore the intimate linkage of interior Antarctic climate to tropical variability. Further, this study shows that atmospheric internal variability can induce extreme regional climate change over the Antarctic interior, which has masked any anthropogenic warming signal there during the twenty-first century. Surface air temperatures at the South Pole warmed at over three times the global rate in recent decades. Research shows this trend was driven remotely by the tropics and locally by a positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode, increasing the influx of warm moist air atop anthropogenic warming.},

Here we demonstrate that circulation changes associated with the SAM dominate interannual temperature variability across the entire Antarctic Peninsula during both summer and autumn, while relationships with tropical Pacific SST variability associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are strongest and statistically significant primarily during winter and spring only. We find the ENSO-Peninsula temperature relationship during autumn to be weak on interannual time scales and regional circulation anomalies associated with the SAM more important for interannual temperature variability across the Peninsula during autumn. Consistent with previous studies, western Peninsula temperatures during autumn, winter, and spring are closely tied to changes in the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and associated meridional wind anomalies. The interannual variability of ASL depth is most strongly correlated with the SAM index during autumn, while the ENSO relationship is strongest during winter and spring. Investigation of western and northeast Peninsula temperatures separately reveals that interannual variability of northeast Peninsula temperatures is primarily sensitive to zonal wind anomalies crossing the Peninsula and resultant leeside adiabatic warming rather than to meridional wind anomalies, which is closely tied to variability in the zonal portion of the SAM pattern.},

Other features of STL are specification of amounts of seasonal and trend smoothing that range, in a nearly continuous way, from a very small amount of smoothing to a very large amount; robust estimates of the trend and seasonal components that are not distorted by aberrant behavior in the data; specification of the period of the seasonal component to any integer multiple of the time sampling interval greater than one; and the ability to decompose time series with missing values.},

abstract = {The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate models. After a record high extent in 2012 the extent was even higher in 2014 when the magnitude exceeded 20 3 10 6 km 2 for the first time during the satellite era. The positive trend is confirmed with newly reprocessed sea ice data that addressed inconsistency issues in the time series. The variability in sea ice extent and ice area was studied alongside surface ice temperature for the 34-yr period starting in 1981, and the results of the analysis show a strong correlation of 20.94 during the growth season and 20.86 during the melt season. The correlation coefficients are even stronger with a one-month lag in surface temperature at 20.96 during the growth season and 20.98 during the melt season, suggesting that the trend in sea ice cover is strongly influenced by the trend in surface temperature. The correlation with atmospheric circulation as represented by the southern annular mode (SAM) index appears to be relatively weak. A case study comparing the record high in 2014 with a relatively low ice extent in 2015 also shows strong sensitivity to changes in surface temperature. The results suggest that the positive trend is a consequence of the spatial variability of global trends in surface temperature and that the ability of current climate models to forecast sea ice trend can be improved through better performance in reproducing observed surface temperatures in the Antarctic region.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects.

We show that positive SAM anomalies in the austral summer are associated with anomalously cold SSTs that persist and lead to anomalous ice growth in the following autumn, while negative SAM anomalies precede warm SSTs and a reduction in sea ice extent during autumn. The largest effect occurs in April, when a unit change in the detrended summertime SAM is followed by a 1.8±0.6 ×105 km2 change in detrended sea ice extent. We find no evidence that sea ice extent anomalies related to the summertime SAM affect the wintertime sea ice extent maximum. Our analysis shows that the wind anomalies related to the negative SAM during the 2016/2017 austral summer contributed to the record minimum Antarctic sea ice extent observed in March 2017.},

abstract = {Over the 40‐year satellite record, there has been a slight increasing trend in total annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent of approximately 1.5{\%} per decade that is made up of the sum of significantly larger opposing regional trends. However, record increases in total Antarctic sea ice extent were observed during 2012‑2014, followed by record lows (for the satellite era) through 2018. There is still no consensus on the main drivers of these trends, but it is generally believed that the atmosphere plays a significant role and that seasonal timescales and regional scale processes are important. Despite considerable yearly and regional variability, the mean seasonal cycle of growth and melt of Antarctic sea ice is strikingly consistent, with a slow growth but fast melt season. If we are to project trends in Antarctic sea ice and understand changes on longer timescales, we need to understand the mechanisms related to the seasonal cycle separately from those that drive variability. Twice‐yearly changes in the position and intensity of the zonal winds circling Antarctica are thought to drive the system by working with or against the evolving sea ice edge to slow the autumn advance and hasten the spring melt. Open water regions, created by divergence associated with the zonal winds, amplify the spring melt through increased warming of the upper ocean. Climate models fail to accurately reproduce mean Antarctic sea ice extent and overestimate its year‐to‐year variability, but they tend to capture the pattern and timing of the Antarctic seasonal cycle.},

abstract = {Recent estimates indicate that the Antarctic sea ice cover is expanding at a statistically significant rate with a magnitude one-third as large as the rapid rate of sea ice retreat in the Arctic. However, during the mid-2000s, with several fewer years in the observational record, the trend in Antarctic sea ice extent was reported to be considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Here, we show that much of the increase in the reported trend occurred due to the previously undocumented effect of a change in the way the satellite sea ice observations are processed for the widely used Bootstrap algorithm data set, rather than a physical increase in the rate of ice advance. Specifically, we find that a change in the intercalibration across a 1991 sensor transition when the data set was reprocessed in 2007 caused a substantial change in the long-term trend. Although our analysis does not definitively identify whether this change introduced an error or removed one, the resulting difference in the trends suggests that a substantial error exists in either the current data set or the version that was used prior to the mid-2000s, and numerous studies that have relied on these observations should be reexamined to determine the sensitivity of their results to this change in the data set. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have investigated physical mechanisms for the observed expansion of the Antarctic sea ice cover. The results of this analysis raise the possibility that much of this expansion may be a spurious artifact of an error in the processing of the satellite observations.},

abstract = {The response of the Southern Ocean to a repeating seasonal cycle of ozone loss is studied in two coupled climate models and is found to comprise both fast and slow processes. The fast response is similar to the interannual signature of the southern annular mode (SAM) on sea surface temperature (SST), onto which the ozone hole forcing projects in the summer. It comprises enhanced northward Ekman drift, inducing negative summertime SST anomalies around Antarctica, earlier sea ice freeze-up the following winter, and northward expansion of the sea ice edge year-round. The enhanced northward Ekman drift, however, results in upwelling of warm waters from below the mixed layer in the region of seasonal sea ice. With sustained bursts of westerly winds induced by ozone hole depletion, this warming from below eventually dominates over the cooling from anomalous Ekman drift. The resulting slow timescale response (years to decades) leads to warming of SSTs around Antarctica and ultimately a reduction in sea ice cover year-round. This two-timescale behavior-rapid cooling followed by slow but persistent warming-is found in the two coupled models analyzed: one with an idealized geometry and the other with a complex global climate model with realistic geometry. Processes that control the time scale of the transition from cooling to warming and their uncertainties are described. Finally the implications of these results are discussed for rationalizing previous studies of the effect of the ozone hole on SST and sea ice extent.},

There is a distinct annual contrast between the 1980s and the 1990s, with the strong teleconnection in the 1990s being explained by an enhanced response during austral spring. Geopotential height anomaly composites constructed during the peak ENSO seasons also demonstrate the decadal variability. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis reveals that the 1980s September-November (SON) tele-connection is weak due to the interference between the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern associated with ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). An in-phase relationship between these two modes during SON in the 1990s amplifies the height and pressure anomalies in the South Pacific, producing the strong teleconnections seen in the correlation and composite analyses. The in-phase relationship between the tropical and high-latitude forcing also exists in December-February (DJF) during the 1980s and 1990s. These results suggest that natural climate variability plays an important role in the variability of SAM, in agreement with a growing body of literature. Additionally, the significantly positive correlation between ENSO and SAM only during times of strong teleconnection suggests that both the Tropics and the high latitudes need to work together in order for ENSO to strongly influence Antarctic climate.},

abstract = {In early 1994 the city of Auckland (New Zealand) was in the midst of a major water supply crisis. El Nin?o was blamed, and it is now a widely held view that Auckland's droughts and wet periods are predominantly a consequence of the El Nin?o-southern oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The scientific literature is consistent with a significant influence of ENSO on New Zealand's climate, but is less convincing that it is the dominant forcing factor for Auckland's droughts and wet periods. To investigate this, we constructed a seasonal history of 20th century droughts and wet periods and compared it with a seasonal time series of ENSO activity based on the southern oscillation index. Our drought/wetness index was derived from daily modelling of soil water content and used the climatological potential evaporation method advocated by Fowler (2002. Journal of Hydrology 256: 248-263) for century-scale soil water modelling. In deriving this index we identified a seasonal bias issue associated with soil-water-based methods and developed a simple index calculation method to circumvent the problem. Comparison of the ENSO and drought/wetness indices does not support the contention that droughts and wet periods in Auckland are primarily associated with ENSO. Relationships are weak and inconsistent (especially between La Nin?as and wet periods), and decadal-scale variation in ENSO activity is not coupled with changes in the frequency and magnitude of droughts and wet periods. Many droughts and wet periods do not coincide with ENSO events, and many ENSO events have little impact. These findings were confirmed by a mean sea-level pressure compositing analysis. This linked droughts and wet periods with synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that show no significant relationship to the pressure anomaly patterns associated with ENSO events. We conclude that ENSO has been overrated as a cause of Auckland's droughts and wet periods, and that it would be appropriate to focus more attention on identifying and investigating other plausible forcing factors.

abstract = {El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural, coupled atmospheric-oceanic cycle that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean on an approximate timescale of 2-7 yr. ENSO events have been shown in previous studies to be related to regional extremes in weather (e.g., hurricane occurrences, frequency and severity of tornadoes, droughts, and floods). The teleconnection of ENSO events to extreme weather events means that the ability to classify an event as El Ni{\~{n}}o or La Ni{\~{n}}a is of interest in scientific and other applications. ENSO is most often classified using indices that indicate the warmth and coolness of equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Another commonly used index is based on sea level pressure differences measured across the tropical Pacific Ocean. More recently, other indices have been proposed and have been shown to be effective in describing ENSO events. There is currently no consensus within the scientific community as to which of many indices best captures ENSO phases. The goal of this study is to compare several commonly used ENSO indices and to determine whether or not one index is superior in defining ENSO events; or alternatively, to determine which indices are best for various applications. The response and sensitivity of the SST-based indices and pressure-based indices are compared. The Ni{\~{n}}o-4 index has a relatively weak response to El Ni{\~{n}}o; the Ni{\~{n}}o- 1+2 index has a relatively strong response to La Ni{\~{n}}a. Analysis of the sensitivity of the indices relative to one another suggests that the choice of index to use in ENSO studies is dependent upon the phase of ENSO that is to be studied. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) index is found to be more sensitive to La Ni{\~{n}}a events than all other indices. The Southern Oscillation, Ni{\~{n}}o-3.4, and Ni{\~{n}}o-4 indices are almost equally sensitive to El Ni{\~{n}}o events and are more sensitive than the JMA, Ni{\~{n}}o-1+2, and Ni{\~{n}}o-3 indices.},

Consistent with work by Ferreira et al. (J Clim 28:1206–1226, 2015. doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00313.1), the models generally simulate a two-timescale response to positive SAM anomalies, with an initial increase in ice followed by an eventual sea ice decline. However, the models differ in the cross-over time at which the change in ice response occurs, in the overall magnitude of the response, and in the spatial distribution of the response. Late twentieth century Antarctic sea ice trends in CMIP5 simulations are related in part to different modeled responses to SAM variability acting on different time-varying transient SAM conditions. This explains a significant fraction of the spread in simulated late twentieth century southern hemisphere sea ice extent trends across the model simulations. Applying the modeled sea ice response to SAM variability but driven by the observed record of SAM suggests that variations in the austral summer SAM, which has exhibited a significant positive trend, have driven a modest sea ice decrease. However, additional work is needed to narrow the considerable model uncertainty in the climate response to SAM variability and its implications for 20th–21st century trends.},

The extreme sea ice retreat was accompanied by widespread warming along the coastal areas as well as in the interior of the Antarctic continent. This exceptional event occurred along with a strong negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the moistest and warmest spring on record, over large areas covering the Indian Ocean, the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. In October 2016, the positive anomalies of the totally integrated water vapor (IWV) and 2 m air temperature (T2m) over the Indian Ocean, western Pacific, Bellingshausen Sea and southern part of Ross Sea were unprecedented in the last 39 years. In October and November 2016, when the largest magnitude of negative daily sea ice concentration anomalies was observed, repeated episodes of poleward advection of warm and moist air took place. These results suggest the importance of moist and warm air intrusions into the Antarctic region as one of the main contributors to this exceptional sea ice retreat event.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A number of events that appear in atmospheric time series result from as yet unidentified physical mechanisms. This is particularly the case for stable boundary layers, where the usual statistical turbulence approaches do not work well and increasing evidence relates the bulk of their dynamics to generally unknown individual events. This study explores the possibility of extracting and classifying events from time series without previous knowledge of their generating mechanisms. The goal is to group large numbers of events in a useful way that will open a pathway for the detailed study of their characteristics, and help gain understanding of events with previously unknown origin. A two-step method is developed that extracts events from background fluctuations and groups dynamically similar events into clusters. The method is tested on artificial time series with different levels of complexity and on atmospheric turbulence time series. The results indicate that the method successfully recognizes and classifies various events of unknown origin, and even distinguishes different physical characteristics based only on a single-variable time series. The method is simple and highly flexible, and it does not assume any knowledge about the shape geometries, amplitudes or underlying physical mechanisms. Therefore, with proper modifications, it can be applied to time series from a wider range of research areas.},

abstract = {We investigate how sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around Antarctica respond to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on multiple timescales. To that end we examine the relationship between SAM and SST within unperturbed preindustrial control simulations of coupled general circulation models (GCMs) included in the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We develop a technique to extract the response of the Southern Ocean SST (55°S–70°S) to a hypothetical step increase in the SAM index. We demonstrate that in many GCMs, the expected SST step response function is nonmonotonic in time. Following a shift to a positive SAM anomaly, an initial cooling regime can transition into surface warming around Antarctica. However, there are large differences across the CMIP5 ensemble. In some models the step response function never changes sign and cooling persists, while in other GCMs the SST anomaly crosses over from negative to positive values only 3 years after a step increase in the SAM. This intermodel diversity can be related to differences in the models' climatological thermal ocean stratification in the region of seasonal sea ice around Antarctica. Exploiting this relationship, we use observational data for the time-mean meridional and vertical temperature gradients to constrain the real Southern Ocean response to SAM on fast and slow timescales.},

abstract = {In the past years, the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes have suffered from severe winters like the extreme 2012/2013 winter in Eastern USA. These cold spells were linked to a meandering upper tropospheric jet stream pattern and a negative Arctic Oscillation Index (AO). However, the nature of the drivers behind these circulation patterns remains controversial. Various studies have proposed different mechanisms related to changes in the Arctic, most of them related to a reduction in sea ice concentrations or increasing Eurasian snow cover. Here, a novel type of time series analysis, called Causal Effect Networks (CEN) based on graphical models is introduced to assess causal relationships and their time-delays between different processes. The effect of different Arctic actors on winter circulation on weekly to monthly time-scales is studied and robust network patterns are found. Barents and Kara sea ice concentrations are detected to be important external drivers of the mid-latitude circulation, influencing winter AO via tropospheric mechanisms and through processes involving the Stratosphere. Eurasia snow cover is also detected to have a causal effect on sea level pressure in Asia, but its exact role on AO remains unclear. The CEN approach presented in this study overcomes some difficulties in interpreting correlation analyses, complements model experiments for testing hypotheses involving teleconnections, and can be used to assess their validity. Our findings confirm that sea ice concentrations in autumn in the Barents and Kara Seas are an important driver of winter circulation in the mid-latitudes.},
annote = {This paper was one suggested by Judith Berner after the talk at ANZIAM. It deals with constructing networks between different variables in Arctic weather data.

This is potentially something we could follow as a preliminary investigation for what sort of variable relationships we might expect to see. As we are ignoring spatial distributions, we should be able to get an initial understanding of some of the dynamics which could be seen over the continent.

We could also use this paper to test our method of constructing a network between variables.},

abstract = {Across geosciences, many investigated phenomena relate to specific complex systems consisting of intricately intertwined interacting subsystems. Such dynamical complex systems can be represented by a directed graph, where each link denotes an existence of a causal relation, or information exchange between the nodes. For geophysical systems such as global climate, these relations are commonly not theoretically known but estimated from recorded data using causality analysis methods. These include bivariate nonlinear methods based on information theory and their linear counterpart. The trade-off between the valuable sensitivity of nonlinear methods to more general interactions and the potentially higher numerical reliability of linear methods may affect inference regarding structure and variability of climate networks. We investigate the reliability of directed climate networks detected by selected methods and parameter settings, using a stationarized model of dimensionality-reduced surface air temperature data from reanalysis of 60-year global climate records. Overall, all studied bivariate causality methods provided reproducible estimates of climate causality networks, with the linear approximation showing higher reliability than the investigated nonlinear methods. On the example dataset, optimizing the investigated nonlinear methods with respect to reliability increased the similarity of the detected networks to their linear counterparts, supporting the particular hypothesis of the near-linearity of the surface air temperature reanalysis data.},

abstract = {The anomalies in the climate and sea ice cover of the Southern Ocean and their relationships with the Southern Oscillation (SO) are investigated using a 17-yr dataset from 1982 to 1998. The polar climate anomalies are correlated with the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the composites of these anomalies are examined under the positive (SOI ? 0), neutral (0 ? SOI ??1), and negative (SOI ??1) phases of SOI. The climate dataset consists of sea level pressure, wind, surface air temperature, and sea surface temperature fields, while the sea ice dataset describes its extent, concentration, motion, and surface temperature. The analysis depicts, for the first time, the spatial variability in the relationship of the above variables with the SOI. The strongest correlation between the SOI and the polar climate anomalies are found in the Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and Ross Seas. The composite fields reveal anomalies that are organized in distinct large-scale spatial patterns with opposing polarities at the two extremes of SOI, and suggest oscillations that are closely linked to the SO. Within these sectors, positive (negative) phases of the SOI are generally associated with lower (higher) sea level pressure, cooler (warmer) surface air temperature, and cooler (warmer) sea surface temperature in these sectors. Asso- ciations between these climate anomalies and the behavior of the Antarctic sea ice cover are evident. Recent anomalies in the sea ice cover that are clearly associated with the SOI include the following: the record decrease in the sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea from mid-1988 to early 1991; the relationship between Ross Sea SST and the ENSO signal, and reduced sea ice concentration in the Ross Sea; and the shortening of the ice season in the eastern Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea, far western Weddell Sea and lengthening of the ice season in the western Ross Sea, Bellinghausen Sea, and central Weddell Sea gyre during the period 1988–94. Four ENSO episodes over the last 17 years contributed to a negative mean in the SOI (?0.5). In each of these episodes, significant retreats in ice cover of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas were observed showing a unique association of this region of the Antarctic with the Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {Sensitivity studies with global climate models show that, by their influence on the radiation balance, Antarctic clouds play a major role in the climate system, both directly at high southern latitudes and indirectly globally, as the local circulation changes lead to global teleconnections. Unfortunately, observations of cloud distribution in the Antarctic are limited and often of low quality because of the practical difficulty in observing clouds in the harsh Antarctic environment. The best surface observations suggest that the fractional cloud cover at the South Pole is around 50-60{\%} in all seasons, whereas the cloud cover rises to around 80-90{\%} close to the coast of the continent. Microphysical observations of cloud parameters are also very sparse in the Antarctic. However, the few measurements that do exist show predominantly ice-crystal clouds across the interior, with mixed-phase clouds close to the coasts. Crystal sizes vary from 5 to 30 mm (effective radius) in the interior to somewhat larger ice crystals and water drops near the coast. A wide range of crystal shapes is observed at all sites. This review considers the available cloud observations and highlights the importance of Antarctic clouds and the need for better observations in the future.},

abstract = {Precious little is known about the composition of low-level clouds over the Antarctic Plateau and their effect on climate. In situ measurements at the South Pole using a unique tethered balloon system and ground-based lidar reveal a much higher than anticipated incidence of low-level, mixed-phase clouds (i.e., consisting of supercooled liquid water drops and ice crystals). The high incidence of mixed-phase clouds is currently poorly represented in global climate models (GCMs). As a result, the effects that mixed-phase clouds have on climate predictions are highly uncertain. We modify the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) GCM to align with the new observations and evaluate the radiative effects on a continental scale. The net cloud radiative effects (CREs) over Antarctica are increased by +7.4 Wm(-2), and although this is a significant change, a much larger effect occurs when the modified model physics are extended beyond the Antarctic continent. The simulations show significant net CRE over the Southern Ocean storm tracks, where recent measurements also indicate substantial regions of supercooled liquid. These sensitivity tests confirm that Southern Ocean CREs are strongly sensitive to mixed-phase clouds colder than -20 °C.},

abstract = {The global sea ice-ocean model ORCA2-LIM is used to investigate the impact of the thermal and mechanical forcing associated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on the Antarctic sea ice-ocean system. The model is driven by idealized forcings based on regressions between the wind stress and the air temperature at one hand and the SAMindex the other hand. The wind-stress component strongly affects the overall patterns of the ocean circulation with a northward surface drift, a downwelling at about 45° S and an upwelling in the vicinity of the Antarctic continent when the SAM is positive. On the other hand, the thermal forcing has a negligible effect on the ocean currents. For sea ice, both the wind-stress (mechanical) and the air temperature (thermal) components have a significant impact. The mechanical part induces a decrease of the sea ice thickness close to the continent and a sharp decrease of the mean sea ice thickness in the Weddell sector. In general, the sea ice area also diminishes, with a maximum decrease in the Weddell Sea. On the contrary, the thermal part tends to increase the ice concentration in all sectors except in the Weddell Sea, where the ice area shrinks. This thermal effect is the strongest in autumn and in winter due to the larger temperature differences associated with the SAM during these seasons. The sum of the thermal and mechaninal effects gives a dipole response of sea ice to the SAM, with a decrease of the ice area in the Weddell Sea and around the Antarctic Peninsula and an increase in the Ross and Amundsen Seas during high SAM years. This is in good agreement with the observed response of the ice cover to the SAM. {\textcopyright} 2005 Author(s).},

abstract = {This study evaluates simulated Antarctic sea ice edge (SIE) variability and its teleconnections in three global coupled climate models (GISS, NCAR and GFDL) against the observations. All models do a reasonable job in simulating the seasonal advance and retreat of the Antarctic sea ice fields. The simulated GISS and NCAR SIE distributions are in agreement with observations in summer and autumn, whereas the GFDL model does best in spring and winter. A common problem is the poor simulation of the observed SIE in the Weddell Sea. All models are not particularly good at simulating the observed regionally varying SIE trends. A comparison of dominant empirical orthogonal function modes of surface air temperature (SAT) variability in each model associated with observed modes show that the models generally capture features of the more prominent covarying spatial patterns such as an El Ni˜ no–southern oscillation (ENSO)-like pattern in the tropical Pacific. The simulated teleconnection patterns between detrended Antarctic SIE anomalies and detrended global SAT anomalies in each model are evaluated for comparison with observed teleconnection patterns. All models capture the ENSO-like phenomenon to some degree. Also, the GISS and NCAR models capture the Antarctic dipole pattern and meridional banding structure through the Pacific. The Antarctic SIE regions showing the strongest extrapolar teleconnections differ among the models and between the models and observations. Almost all models miss the observed polar–extrapolar teleconnections in the central Indian, western extreme of the tropical and southern Pacific, and over the tropical continents.},

@article{Lorrey2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Royal Meteorological Society We objectively identified an optimal number of atmospheric weather regimes, also called synoptic types, within the southwest (SW) Pacific tropical–subtropical domain and examined their potential drivers. Six atmospheric weather regimes in this region are characterized by spatially heterogeneous geopotential height, sea surface temperature, and regional precipitation patterns. The identified weather regimes are phase-locked to the seasonal cycle with a moderate degree of coherency, and some are capable of persisting for weeks or more in extreme cases. Correlations between the SW Pacific weather regimes and global precipitation reanalysis fields indicate a strong connection between regional weather patterns and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) mean position changes and relative intensity of convective loci within the SPCZ. Climate field correlations to SW Pacific weather regimes also show distinct geopotential height and SST signatures across Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes and the Indian Ocean basin. Strong statistical significance for portions of those spatial patterns lends support to the assertion of extra-basin teleconnections for SW Pacific weather regimes. There are strong precipitatio n impacts from SW Pacific weather regime frequency changes and regime persistence on extreme rainfall deficits and/or surpluses for small islands during austral summer. Diagnostic analysis of the spatial correlation fields and each weather regime indicates these weather patterns are connected to eastern equatorial Pacific-styles of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a and Modoki La Ni{\~{n}}a. Another regime type appears to be connected to an enhancement of the Hadley–Ferrell circulation, while two other types are influenced by phenomena that arise outside the Pacific basin (Madden–Julian oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, and Pacific South American mode). SW Pacific weather regime investigations in the context of modern climate, palaeoclimatology, and future climate change scenarios can help to surmount spatial-scale mismatches that exist between global models and small Pacific islands, while helping to improve general understanding of island-scale impacts from atmospheric circulation.},

abstract = {Several papers have described a significant trend toward the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere.

The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a "true" benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined.

abstract = {Antarctic sea-ice extent has been slowly increasing in the satellite record that began in 1979. Since the late 1990s, the increase has accelerated, but the average of all climate models shows a decline. Meanwhile, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, an internally generated mode of climate variability, transitioned from positive to negative, with an average cooling of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, a slowdown of the global warming trend and a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low near Antarctica that has contributed to regional circulation changes in the Ross Sea region and expansion of sea ice. Here we show that the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in global coupled climate models is characterized by anomalies similar to the observed sea-level pressure and near-surface 850 hPa wind changes near Antarctica since 2000 that are conducive to expanding Antarctic sea-ice extent, particularly in the Ross Sea region in all seasons, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low. These atmospheric circulation changes are shown to be mainly driven by precipitation and convective heating anomalies related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in the equatorial eastern Pacific, with additional contributions from convective heating anomalies in the South Pacific convergence zone and tropical Atlantic regions.},

abstract = {After nearly three decades of observed increasing trends of Antarctic sea ice extent, in September-October-November 2016, there was a dramatic decrease. Here we document factors that contributed to that decrease. An atmosphere-only model with a specified positive convective heating anomaly in the eastern Indian/western Pacific Ocean, representing the record positive precipitation anomalies there in September-October-November 2016, produces an anomalous atmospheric Rossby wave response with mid- and high latitude surface wind anomalies that contribute to the decrease of Antarctic sea ice extent. The sustained decreases of Antarctic sea ice extent after late 2016 are associated with a warmer upper Southern Ocean. This is the culmination of a negative decadal trend of wind stress curl with positive Southern Annular Mode and negative Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, Ekman suction that results in warmer water being moved upward in the column closer to the surface, a transition to positive Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation around 2014–2016, and negative Southern Annular Mode in late 2016.},

abstract = {The influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies on New Zealand climate variations is examined systematically, using data for the period 1949-1991. New Zealand temperature and precipitation anomalies, both monthly and seasonal, are represented in terms of rotated EOF patterns, the time series of which are then cross-correlated against sea-surface temperature data for an extensive region of the Southern Hemisphere. Relationships with mean sea level pressure anomalies in the Australasian region are examined to clarify significant associations found. Monthly lead and lag cross-correlations suggest that sea temperatures in the immediate vicinity of New Zealand are responding to atmospheric circulation variations, a result that is consistent with many similar studies elsewhere regarding midlatitude sea temperature anomalie. New Zealand temperatures, particularly in the North Island, are also significantly correlated to the previous month's sea-surface temperature anomaly in the western Tasman Sea and south of Australia, but only in autumn months (March, April, May). Subsequent analysis suggests the most likely cause of this is atmospheric forcing in the antecedent month. On the seasonal time scale, a number of SST-New Zealand climate lag relationships are found, many of which appear to be related to ENSO variations. However, tropical Indian Ocean SSTs unrelated to ENSO are prominent in the autumn-winter period. One phase of this teleconnection pattern is for warmer Indian Ocean waters in autumn to be followed by a stronger subtropical ridge just north of North Island in winter, stronger westerly flow over the country, higher South Island temperatures, more rainfall in west South Island districts and drier conditions in other areas of the country exposed to the north and east.},

Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as "modularity" over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

abstract = {1 We demonstrate a mechanism whereby the impact of stronger circumpolar westerly winds on the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula contributes significantly to the enhanced warming trend observed over its western side in the last 50 years. Numerical and laboratory meteorological modelling demonstrate how, when westerly winds impinge on this side, warm air below the height (1.5-2.0 km) of the Peninsula is advected in a southerly direction. The strength of the annual mean westerly winds has increased by about 15-20{\%} since the 1960s, while the modelling results indicate that contemporaneously the air advected to its western side originates from an increasingly northerly (and warmer) location. This gives rise to increased northerlies and a greater transport of warm air into this region. Consequently there is a reduction in the sea-ice extent, further amplifying the local warming. This 'low-level', orographic mechanism for the local climate trend is supported by observational evidence.},

In contrast, it took the Arctic sea ice cover a full 3 decades to register a loss that great in yearly average ice extents. Still, when considering the 40-y record as a whole, the Antarctic sea ice continues to have a positive overall trend in yearly average ice extents, although at 11,300 ± 5,300 km 2 ⋅y −1 , this trend is only 50{\%} of the trend for 1979–2014, before the precipitous decline. Four of the 5 sectors into which the Antarctic sea ice cover is divided all also have 40-y positive trends that are well reduced from their 2014–2017 values. The one anomalous sector in this regard, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has a 40-y negative trend, with the yearly average ice extents decreasing overall in the first 3 decades, reaching a minimum in 2007, and exhibiting an overall upward trend since 2007 (i.e., reflecting a reversal in the opposite direction from the other 4 sectors and the Antarctic sea ice cover as a whole). },

Results for the Weddell Sea are mixed, with the northwestern portion of the sea having experienced a shortening of the sea-ice season but a substantial area in the south–central portion of the sea having experienced a lengthening of the ice season. Overall, the area of the Southern Ocean experiencing a lengthening of the sea-ice season by at least 1day per year over the period 1979–99 is 5.6 × 10 6 km 2 , whereas the area experiencing a shortening of the sea-ice season by at least 1 day per year is 46{\%} less than that, at 3.0 × 16 6 km 2 .},

Decreases occur in all seasons and on a yeafly average basis, although they are largest in spring and smallest in autumn. Regionally, the Kara and Barents Seas have the largest decreases, at-15,200 + 1900 km2/yr (-10.5{\%}/decade), followed by the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan, the Arctic Ocean, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, and Canadian Archipelago. The yeafly average trends for the total, the Kara and Barents Seas, and the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan all have high statistical significance, with the null hypothesis of a 0 slope being rejected at a 99{\%} confidence level. Regions showing increasing yeafly average ice extents are Baffin Bay/Labrador Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Bering Sea, with only the increases in the Gulf of St. Lawrence being statistically significant at the 99{\%} level. Hemispheric results for sea ice areas exhibit the same-2.8{\%}/decade decrease as for ice extents and hence a lower absolute decrease (-29,500 + 3800 km2/yr), with the ice-free area within the ice pack correspondingly decreasing at-4800 + 1600 km2/yr. Confidence levels for the trends in ice areas and ice-free water areas exceed 99{\%} and 95{\%}, respectively. Nonetheless, interannual variability is high, and, for instance, the Arctic Ocean ice extents have a positive trend 1990-1996, in spite of their negative trend for the time period as a whole.},

This has altered the solar radiation forcing on the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system by decreasing the surface albedo and allowing more solar heating of the upper ocean. This study addresses how the amount of solar energy absorbed in areas of open water in the Arctic Basin has varied spatially and temporally over the past few decades. A synthetic approach was taken, combining satellite-derived ice concentrations, incident irradiances determined from reanalysis products, and field observations of ocean albedo over the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent seas. Results indicate an increase in the solar energy deposited in the upper ocean over the past few decades in 89{\%} of the region studied.

We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn{\^{}}2) and space O(n{\^{}}2) in the worst case, and in time O(n{\^{}}2log n) and space O(n{\^{}}2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.

The techniques employed for the characterization of these materials were ICP-MS, TEM, XRD, BET, and XAS. Au L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were carried out over a series of rare earth materials containing gold nanoparticles. The size of gold nanoparticles varied in the range of ???2 to 6 nm in the Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La materials. These materials possess surface areas ranging from 29 to 41 m2/g with the high phase purity and crystallinity of the support (Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La) materials. An X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES, EXAFS) technique was used in obtaining critical information about the atomic distances, bonding and neighbouring environment for gold atoms in the rare earth Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La oxide materials for understanding the typical characteristics and structure of gold nanoparticles in these materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {McLean et al. (2009) (henceforth MFC09) claim that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as represented by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), accounts for as much as 72{\%} of the global tropospheric temperature anomaly and an even higher 81{\%} of this anomaly in the tropics. They conclude that the SOI is a "dominant and consistent influence on mean global temperatures," "and perhaps recent trends in global temperatures." However, their analysis is inappropriate in a number of ways and overstates the influence of ENSO on the climate system. This comment first briefly reviews what is understood about the influence of ENSO on global temperatures and then shows that the analysis of MFC09 greatly overestimates the correlation between temperature anomalies and the SOI by inflating the power in the 2-6 year time window while filtering out variability on longer and shorter time scales. The suggestion in their conclusions that ENSO may be a major contributor to recent trends in global temperature is not supported by their analysis or any physical theory presented in their paper, especially as the analysis method itself eliminates the influence of trends on the purported correlations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, ISB. Analysis of airborne pollen concentrations provides valuable information on plant phenology and is thus a useful tool in agriculture—for predicting harvests in crops such as the olive and for deciding when to apply phytosanitary treatments—as well as in medicine and the environmental sciences. Variations in airborne pollen concentrations, moreover, are indicators of changing plant life cycles. By modeling pollen time series, we can not only identify the variables influencing pollen levels but also predict future pollen concentrations. In this study, airborne pollen time series were modeled using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) smoothing (STL). The data series— daily Poaceae pollen concentrations over the period 2006–2014—was broken up into seasonal and residual (stochastic) components. The seasonal component was compared with data on Poaceae flowering phenology obtained by field sampling. Residuals were fitted to a model generated from daily temperature and rainfall values, and daily pollen concentrations, using partial least squares regression (PLSR). This method was then applied to predict daily pollen concentrations for 2014 (independent validation data) using results for the seasonal component of the time series and estimates of the residual component for the period 2006–2013. Correlation between predicted and observed values was r = 0.79 (correlation coefficient) for the pre-peak period (i.e., the period prior to the peak pollen concentration) and r = 0.63 for the post-peak period. Separate analysis of each of the components of the pollen data series enables the sources of variability to be identified more accurately than by analysis of the original non-decomposed data series, and for this reason, this procedure has proved to be a suitable technique for analyzing the main environmental factors influencing airborne pollen concentrations.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks are so large that we must simplify their structure before we can extract useful information about the systems they represent. As the tools for doing these simplifications proliferate within the network literature, researchers would benefit from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that different methods highlight different aspects of a network's structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system's network structure was formed, as we are in how a network's extant structure influences the system's behavior. To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this flow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to efficiently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.},

abstract = {While it is an important problem to identify the existence of causal associations between two components of a multivariate time series, a topic addressed in Runge et al. (2012), it is even more important to assess the strength of their association in a meaningful way. In the present article we focus on the problem of defining a meaningful coupling strength using information theoretic measures and demonstrate the short-comings of the well-known mutual information and transfer entropy. Instead, we propose a certain time-delayed conditional mutual information, the momentary information transfer (MIT), as a measure of association that is general, causal and lag-specific, reflects a well interpretable notion of coupling strength and is practically computable. MIT is based on the fundamental concept of source entropy, which we utilize to yield a notion of coupling strength that is, compared to mutual information and transfer entropy, well interpretable, in that for many cases it solely depends on the interaction of the two components at a certain lag. In particular, MIT is thus in many cases able to exclude the misleading influence of autodependency within a process in an information-theoretic way. We formalize and prove this idea analytically and numerically for a general class of nonlinear stochastic processes and illustrate the potential of MIT on climatological data.},

abstract = {The observed relationships between anomalous Antarctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and the leading patterns of Southern Hemisphere (SH) large-scale climate variability are examined as a function of season over 1980-2008. Particular emphasis is placed on 1) the interactions between SIC, the southern annular mode (SAM), and El Nin{\{}ogonek{\}} o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and 2) the contribution of these two leading modes to the 29-yr trends in sea ice. Regression, composite, and principal component analyses highlight a seasonality in SH sea ice-atmosphere interactions, whereby Antarctic sea ice variability exhibits the strongest linkages to the SAM and ENSO during the austral cold season months. As noted in previous work, a dipole in SIC anomalies emerges in relation to the SAM, characterized by centers of action located near the Bellingshausen/Weddell and Amundsen/eastern Ross Seas. The structure and magnitude of this SIC dipole is found to vary considerably as a function of season, consistent with the seasonality of the overlying atmospheric circulation anomalies. Relative to the SAM, the pattern of sea ice anomalies linked to ENSO exhibits a similar seasonality but tends to be weaker in amplitude and more diffuse in structure. The relationships between ENSO and sea ice also exhibit a substantial nonlinear component, highlighting the need to consider both season and phase of the ENSO cycle when diagnosing ENSO-SIC linkages. Trends in SIC over 1980-2008 are not significantly related to trends in either theSAMor ENSO during any season, including austral summer when the trend in the SAM is most pronounced. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Ice-core measurements indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial periods were consistently about 80 parts per million lower than during interglacial periods. Previous explanations for this observation have typically had difficulty accounting for either the estimated glacial O2 concentrations in the deep sea, 13C/12C ratios in Antarctic surface waters, or the depth of calcite saturation; also lacking is an explanation for the strong link between atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic air temperature. There is growing evidence that the amount of deep water upwelling at low latitudes is significantly overestimated in most ocean general circulation models and simpler box models previously used to investigate this problem. Here we use a box model with deep-water upwelling confined to south of 55 °S to investigate the glacial–interglacial linkages between Antarctic air temperature and atmospheric CO2 variations. We suggest that low glacial atmospheric CO2 levels might result from reduced deep-water ventilation associated with either year-round Antarctic sea-ice coverage, or wintertime coverage combined with ice-induced stratification during the summer. The model presented here reproduces 67 parts per million of the observed glacial–interglacial CO2 difference, as a result of reduced air–sea gas exchange in the Antarctic region, and is generally consistent with the additional observational constraints.},

While melt onset trends are generally smaller, the timing of melt onset has a large influence on the total amount of solar energy absorbed during summer. The additional heat stored in the upper ocean of approximately 752MJm?2 during the last decade increases sea surface temperatures by 0.5 to 1.5 °C and largely explains the observed delays in autumn freezeup within the Arctic Ocean's adjacent seas. Cumulative anomalies in total absorbed solar radiation from May through September for the most recent pentad locally exceed 300–400MJm?2 in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and East Siberian seas.

abstract = {Sea ice variability within the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and polynyas plays an important role for phytoplank-ton productivity and krill abundance. Therefore, mapping their spatial extent as well as seasonal and interannual variability is essential for understanding how current and future changes in these biologically active regions may impact the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Knowledge of the distribution of MIZ, consolidated pack ice and coastal polynyas in the total Antarctic sea ice cover may also help to shed light on the factors contributing towards recent expansion of the Antarctic ice cover in some regions and contraction in others. The long-term passive microwave satellite data record provides the longest and most consistent record for assessing the proportion of the sea ice cover that is covered by each of these ice categories. However, estimates of the amount of MIZ, consolidated pack ice and polynyas depend strongly on which sea ice algorithm is used. This study uses two popular passive microwave sea ice algorithms, the NASA Team and Bootstrap, and applies the same thresholds to the sea ice concentrations to evaluate the distribution and variability in the MIZ, the consolidated pack ice and coastal polynyas. Results reveal that the seasonal cycle in the MIZ and pack ice is generally similar between both algorithms, yet the NASA Team algorithm has on average twice the MIZ and half the consolidated pack ice area as the Bootstrap algorithm. Trends also differ, with the Bootstrap algorithm suggesting statistically significant trends towards increased pack ice area and no statistically significant trends in the MIZ. The NASA Team algorithm on the other hand indicates statistically significant positive trends in the MIZ during spring. Potential coastal polynya area and amount of broken ice within the consolidated ice pack are also larger in the NASA Team algorithm. The timing of maximum polynya area may differ by as much as 5 months between algorithms. These differences lead to different relationships between sea ice characteristics and biological processes, as illustrated here with the breeding success of an Antarctic seabird.},

It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

abstract = {Brine rejection during the formation of Antarctic sea ice is known to enhance the salinity of dense shelf waters in the Weddell and Ross Seas. As these shelf waters flow off the shelves and descend to the bottom, they entrain ambient deep water to create new bottom water. It is not uncommon for ocean modelers to modify salinity boundary conditions around Antarctica in an attempt to include a “sea ice effect” in their models. However, the degree to which Antarctic salinities are enhanced is usually not quantified or defended. In this paper, studies of shelf hydrography and $\delta$ 18O are reviewed to assess the level of salinity enhancement appropriate for ocean general circulation models. The relevant quantities are 1) the salinity difference between the water masses modified on the shelves and the final offshelf flow and 2) the flux of salt (or freshwater) that gives rise to this salinity difference. Onshelf/offshelf salinity changes in the Weddell and Ross Seas appear to be fairly small, 0.15–0.20 salinity units. The quantity of brine needed to produce this salinification is equivalent to the salt drained from ⩽0.50 m of new sea ice every year. Salt fluxes and salinity distributions from three GCM simulations are then compared. The first model has its surface salinities simply restored to the Levitus observations. Levitus restoring produces a slight freshening in the area of the Weddell and Ross Sea shelves. The global-mean bottom-water salinity in this model is 34.57 psu, which is 0.16 units less than observed. The second model includes a very modest salinity enhancement in the area of the Weddell and Ross Sea shelves This produces a salt flux equivalent to the formation of ∼0.50 m yr−1 of new sea ice. Even though this amount of salt input is close to the amount observed, global-average deep salinities in the second model are only 0.02 units greater than the deep salinities in the fist model. The third model includes a large salinity enrichment, which is applied throughout the Weddell and Row embayments without regard to water depth. Its deep saliinities are 0.18 units higher than the deep salinities in the first model, but the amount of salt pumped into the model greatly exceeds the salt flux in nature. The authors conclude that salt from sea ice is probably not a major influence on the salinity of Antarctic bottom waters. Predicted salinities in ocean GCMs are too fresh because of circulation deficiencies, not because of inadequate boundary conditions. Models that employ large salinity modifications near Antarctica run the risk of grossly distorting the processes of deep-water formation.},

abstract = {The Reference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research (READER) project data set of monthly mean Antarctic near-surface temperature, mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) and wind speed has been used to investigate trends in these quantities over the last 50 years for 19 stations with long records. Eleven of these had warming trends and seven had cooling trends in their annual data (one station had too little data to allow an annual trend to be computed), indicating the spatial complexity of change that has occurred across the Antarctic in recent decades. The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a major warming over the last 50 years, with temperatures at Faraday/Vernadsky station having increased at a rate of 0.56°C decade -1 over the year and 1.09°C decade -1 during the winter; both figures are statistically significant at less than the 5{\%} level. Overlapping 30 year trends of annual mean temperatures indicate that, at all but two of the 10 coastal stations for which trends could be computed back to 1961, the warming trend was greater (or the cooling trend less) during the 1961-90 period compared with 1971-2000. All the continental stations for which MSLP data were available show negative trends in the annual mean pressures over the full length of their records, which we attribute to the trend in recent decades towards the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) being in its high-index state. Except for Halley, where the trends are constant, the MSLP trends for all stations on the Antarctic continent for 1971-2000 were more negative than for 1961-90. All but two of the coastal stations have recorded increasing mean wind speeds over recent decades, which is also consistent with the change  in the nature of the SAM.

The contributions from changes in Southern Hemisphere climate modes, particularly the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the southern annular mode (SAM), are quantified for the austral summer season, December–February (DJF). Increasingly drier conditions over much of New Zealand can be partially explained by the SAM and ENSO.

Flux correction is not used in the experiment. The increase of globally averaged surface air temperature at the time-of CO2 doubling is 3.8 degrees C. The warm subsurface Atlantic layer at intermediate depths in the Arctic, is maintained mainly by the sinking and intrusion of water from the West Spitsbergen Current iii the model and the observations. With increased CO2 in the model, the warmer surface waters are intruded into the upper portion of the Atlantic layer producing an anomalous warming in the model at depths between 200 and 40 m. This resembles an anomalous warm layer near those depths recently observed in the Arctic. As the climate warms and sea ice retreats, low clouds increase over the newly exposed water. Yet the consequent increase of cloud albedo over these regions is more than compensated for by the decrease df surface albedo due to the melting of sea ice. This produces a net decrease of planetary albedo in the Arctic that contributes to a strong ice-albedo feedback and the comparatively high sensitivity of the model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. In the context of global warming, the question of why Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) has increased is one of the most fundamental unsolved mysteries. Although many mechanisms have been proposed, it is still unclear whether the increasing trend is anthropogenically originated or only caused by internal natural variability. In this study, we employ a new method where the underlying natural persistence in the Antarctic SIE can be correctly accounted for. We find that the Antarctic SIE is not simply short-term persistent as assumed in the standard significance analysis, but actually characterized by a combination of both short- and long-term persist ence. By generating surrogate data with the same persistence properties, the SIE trends over Antarctica (as well as five sub-regions) are evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations. It is found that the SIE trends over most sub-regions of Antarctica are not statistically significant. Only the SIE over Ross Sea has experienced a highly significant increasing trend (p = 0.008) which cannot be explained by natural variability. Influenced by the positive SIE trend over Ross Sea, the SIE over the entire Antarctica also increased over the past decades, but the trend is only at the edge of being significant (p = 0.034).},

abstract = {Many remote and local climate variabilities influence Antarctic sea ice at different time scales. The strongest sea ice teleconnection at the interannual time scale was found between El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and a high latitude climate mode named the Antarctic Dipole. The Antarctic Dipole is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between sea ice and surface temperature anomalies in the South Pacific and South Atlantic, manifesting itself and persisting 3-4 seasons after being triggered by the ENSO forcing. This study examines the life cycles of ENSO warm and cold events in the tropics and associated evolution of the ADP in high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. In evaluating the mechanisms that form the ADP, the study suggests a synthesized scheme that links these high latitude processes with ENSO teleconnection in both the Pacific and Atlantic basins. The synthesized scheme suggests that the two main mechanisms responsible for the formation/maintenance of the Antarctic Dipole are the heat flux due to the mean meridional circulation of the regional Ferrel Cell and regional anomalous circulation generated by stationary eddies. The changes in the Hadley Cell, the jet stream in the subtropics, and the Rossby Wave train associated with ENSO link the tropical forcing to these high latitude processes. Moreover, these two mechanisms operate in phase and are comparable in magnitude. The positive feedback between the jet stream and stationary eddies in the atmosphere, the positive feedback within the air-sea-ice system, and the seasonality all reinforce the anomalies, resulting in persistent Antarctic Dipole anomalies.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes advances in research on tropical-polar teleconnections, made roughly over the last decade. Elucidating El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts on high latitudes has remained an important focus along different lines of inquiry. Tropical to polar connections have also been discovered at the intraseasonal time scale, associated with Madden-Julian oscillations (MJOs). On the time scale of decades, changes in MJO phases can result in temperature and sea ice changes in the polar regions of both hemispheres. Moreover, the long-term changes in SST of the western tropical Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and North Atlantic Ocean have been linked to the rapid winter warming around the Antarctic Peninsula, while SST changes in the central tropical Pacific have been linked to the warming in West Antarctica. Rossby wave trains emanating from the tropics remain the key mechanism for tropical and polar teleconnections from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. ENSO-related tropical SST anomalies affect higher-latitude annular modes by modulating mean zonal winds in both the subtropics and midlatitudes. Recent studies have also revealed the details of the interactions between the Rossby wave and atmospheric circulations in high latitudes. We also review some of the hypothesized connections between the tropics and poles in the past, including times when the climate was fundamentally different from present day especially given a larger-than-present-day global cryosphere. In addition to atmospheric Rossby waves forced from the tropics, large polar temperature changes and amplification, in part associated with variability in orbital configuration and solar irradiance, affected the low-high-latitude connections.},

abstract = {El Nino?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is known to be the largest source of interannual variability in the tropical troposphere. However, the variability in the tropical Pacific since 1979 seems to be associated not only with ?canonical? ENSO events but also with a variation thereof known as ENSO Modoki, which is characterized by warm anomalies in the central Pacific, west from those occurring during a typical ENSO. This works analyzes the signal of ENSO Modoki in the stratosphere and compares it to canonical ENSO by using the chemistry-climate Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM3.5). The results reveal a significant warming in the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere during boreal winter months, which propagates downward in early spring; this is absent during canonical warm ENSO events. On the other hand, in the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere, the anomalous warming typical of canonical El Ni�o episodes during boreal winter is not statistically significant during El Ni�o Modoki events. These differences are related in WACCM3.5 to changes in tropical convection and tropospheric teleconnections associated with each type of event. In particular, an enhancement and westward displacement of the anomalous convective area during El Ni�o Modoki episodes is related to an intensification of the Pacific South American teleconnection pattern and a weakening of the Aleutian Low. During cold ENSO Modoki events a significant anomalous cooling is present in the model simulations.},
