\chapter{The Impact of Temperature on Antarctic Ice}

The variable which we found had the largest impact on the behaviour of ice in Antarcica is temperature. This follows naturally from the basic thermodynamics of phase change. As the temperature increases we see lower concentrations of sea ice, and as the temperature increases we see lower concentrations of sea ice. The extent of this relationship will be explored in detail in this chapter. We will first look at the relationship through density plots \textcolor{red}{Check name of plots}. Before calculating correlations and looking at the similarities and differences of the two different variables.


\section{Visually comparing Temperature and Ice}
Before we get into any agregation let's compare the ammount of ice at each time and space coordinate in our dataset with the temperature at the associated grid point.
