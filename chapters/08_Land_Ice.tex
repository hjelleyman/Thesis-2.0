\chapter{Drivers of Antarctic Land Ice}
\label{chap:land_ice}
In chapter \ref{chap:temp_and_ice}, we found that temperature is significant for our understanding of the trends in Antarctic \gls{sic} over the last 40 years. However we found that the relationship between temperature and land ice is not as strong. To understand this we will have to do some more calculations.
